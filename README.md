# Node.js Redis Caching

## Overview
This repository contains code for implementing Redis caching in a Node.js application to improve performance by reducing external API calls and enhancing data retrieval efficiency.

## Features
- Caching Strategy: Utilizes Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
- Cache Management: Handles cache retrieval, storage, and expiration.
- External API Integration: Fetches data from an external API when not found in the cache.
- Performance Benefits: Demonstrates how Redis caching can enhance application performance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Set up Redis and update connection details in `client.js`.

## Usage
1. Start the Node.js server with `node server.js`.
2. Access the application at `http://localhost:9000` to see Redis caching in action.
